* Develop a scrip.

## 2 Source of data
Those data are extract from a project related Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones.
Here are the data for the project:

## 3 About the Scrip
There are 5 steps to accomplish to develop the exercise
* create one data set by merging all others. It requires:
** Read all the tables
** Asign names to the columns
** Merge everything in one data set.
* Extract the measurements required (Mean and Standard deviation)
** Read column names
** Put in a vector the measurements
** Make a concrete subset
* Naming properly every one of the activities in the data set
* Label the data set with descriptive variable names
* Creating anoter tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
** Making second tidy data set
** Writing second tidy data set in txt file

## 4 Variables
a_train, b_train, a_test, b_test, subjecttrain and subjecttest contain the data from the downloaded files.
data1, data2 and subjectdata merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the data1 dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
